# WishListApp
Project created for *Python and SQL: intro / SQL platforms* classes at WNE UW.

Language: 
* English - classes, documentation,
* Polish - code comments,

Semester: I (MA studies).

## About
The main objective of this project was to practice Python programming integrated with SQL, learned during classes. This project is about solving "Christmas problem" i.e. "What to buy?" and "How to say what I really want to get?" with the simple terminal app. The whole story and guide can be found in readme.pdf file. The application has full error handilng procedures (I hope) what was the biggest challenge during development. In this project I learned more about pure python proggraming (lots of types conversion stuff, data structures, workfolow, functions writing and compatibility of all the components) and SQL basics (creating and managing databases, basics queries, integration with python via sqlite3 library). I also learn some pandas (basic stuff). Application has a very nice feature, which is matching users input with the most similar input possible (Group Menu - see: readme.pdf  part 3.b) to be more user friendly. 

## Repository description
 * WishListApp.py - python script with application,
 * datagase schema.png - .png file with database structure and relations,
 * readme.pdf - documentation/guide how to use the app,
 * wishListDF.csv - helper .csv file (application uses it),
 * wish_database.py - python script for creating a new database,
 * wishlist.db - created database.

So, it is possible to create a new database or use the one created before.<br>

## Running the app
The application can be runned with terminal.<br>
Requirements:
 * python 3.xx,
 * sqlite3 library installed,
 * pandas library installed,
 * ast library installed,
 * difflib library installed.

## Technologies
 * Python,
 * SQL.

## Authors
  * Bartłomiej Kuźma,
  * Maciej Odziemczyk.

## Notes
Some of the proposed solutions result from course requirements.
